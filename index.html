            The SimTube is a feedback tool that utilizes VLM to digest the video

            Abstract
          </h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Audience feedback is crucial for refining video content, yet it
            typically comes after publication, limiting creators' ability to
            make timely adjustments. To bridge this gap, we introduce SimTube, a
            generative AI system designed to simulate audience feedback in the
            form of video comments before a video's release. SimTube features a
            computational pipeline that integrates multimodal data from the
            video—such as visuals, audio, and metadata—with user personas
            derived from a broad and diverse corpus of audience demographics,
            generating varied and contextually relevant feedback. Furthermore,
            the system's UI allows creators to explore and customize the
            simulated comments. Through a comprehensive evaluation—comprising
            quantitative analysis, crowd-sourced assessments, and qualitative
            user studies—we show that SimTube's generated comments are not only
            relevant, believable, and diverse but often more detailed and
            informative than actual audience comments, highlighting its
            potential to help creators refine their content before release.

            Starting from how the audience would perceive a video, from clicking
            the video that interests them, watching the video, acquiring the
            content, to leaving their comments. The backend pipeline consists of
            three primary components, as illustrated in Fig 1: (a) a Video
            Understanding module, which captures the semantics of video content
            through multimodal summarization; (b) a Persona Query module, which
            retrieves relevant user personas for providing feedback on the
            video; and (c) Comment Generation, which combines video
            understanding and user persona information to generate and present
            comments in the UI, allowing user interaction.

            User Scenario
          </h2>

          <p class="text-justify w-full">
            SimTube is designed to assist video creators with video rough-cut
            versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many participants (P4, P6, P8) emphasized creating rough-cut
            versions or teasers during the editing phase, enabling collaboration
            and feedback from sponsors or team members. As P4 explained, "A
            rough-cut lets my team and sponsors give feedback before we proceed
            further".
          </p>
          <p>
            This suggests that SimTube could enhance this process by providing
            automatic, diverse feedback on uploaded rough cuts. P6 added, "I can
            seamlessly integrate SimTube into my workflow and collect more
            feedback with minimal effort by uploading the rough-cut version or
            any segments whenever I complete one."

          <p class="text-justify">
            SimTube can inspire new video topics. Participants (P1, P3, P6)
            highlighted that AI-generated comments led them to explore new
            ideas. For instance, P1, a travel vlogger, received recommendations
            for famous tourist spots like Ikseon-dong Hanok Village after
            uploading a Korean vlog, even though these places were not featured
            in the video. "SimTube correctly listed all my itineraries based on
            my narration, which helped me plan new vlogs," P1 noted,
            demonstrating the system's ability to generate contextually relevant
            insights.

            SimTube could also influence ongoing video production. P6 uploaded a
            half-finished street interview video on student lifestyles, and the
            persona-based comments generated by SimTube extended the discussion
            between the host and interviewee, introducing new topics such as
            time management for university students. "It prompted me to explore
            this theme further and enriched my video," P6 shared, illustrating
            how SimTube's integration can guide and enhance content creation
            throughout different stages of the workflow.

            According to the crowd-sourced evaluation and the evaluations using
            various automatic metrics, the comments generated by our system
            display superior word-level diversity, while Real Comments showcase
            better semantic diversity. Although a few real comments cover
            distinct common topics, clusters of real comments may be highly
            similar, as reflected by the Self-BLEU score. Concerning relevance
            to video content, generated comments outperform Real Comments in
            word-level, semantic-level, and LLM evaluations. In comparison to
            Real Comments, generated comments tend to be more on-topic,
            authentic, and differentiated, offering a potent source of
            inspiration. Despite their limited semantic diversity, the
            scalability, rapid production, and pre-publication availability make
            generated comments an advantageous preliminary source of inspiration
            and feedback complementing Real Comments, particularly before the
            formal publication of videos.

            These areas present opportunities to expand SimTube's computational
            pipeline to accommodate additional contextual information and enable
            more customized comment generation. Future improvements could also
            include handling longer video inputs and enhancing the overall
            quality of language generation to provide more nuanced and useful
            feedback.

            Integration into Video Production Workflows
          </h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            While we have assessed the quality of our generated comments, the
            system has yet to be deployed in real-world settings. Future
            research should explore integrating SimTube into video editing tools
            or production environments to evaluate its overall impact.
            Qualitative studies could further investigate how the system
            complements professional workflows, providing deeper insights into
            its practical utility. Relevantly, our system generates comments
            only based on a single video version. However, creators often
            produce multiple iterations to determine the best result. By
            analyzing a series of video edits, the system could generate
            comparative feedback highlighting differences between the current
            and previous versions, enabling users to refine their work more
            effectively by leveraging the strengths of each iteration. However,
            expanding to handle multiple versions introduces challenges related
            to system scalability and processing efficiency that warrant future
            explorations.

            Implications of AI-Generated Comments

            We recognize the implications of using AI for human-like comment
